# Vending-Machine-Using-ESP8266

hello Again this is Harsh Mishra 

/* right now i made a free sanitary pad vending machine using a esp8266 , 12V dc motor , motor driver, buttons, and LCD screen
using IC 595 and IC 165 for the more use of GPIO inputs and outputs

my both motors are connected with IC 595 and buttons are connected with the IC 165 
and also in future i will add a coin machine, and card system for more digitize.
 this is two channel vending machine simply in lcd screen its prints for both channel and by pressing buttons it will dispence
